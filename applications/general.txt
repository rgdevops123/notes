Q: What is a Memory Leak?

   It is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program
incorrectly manages memory allocations. In such a way that memory
which is no longer needed is not released. In object-oriented
programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in
memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.  A memory leak has
symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only
be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.

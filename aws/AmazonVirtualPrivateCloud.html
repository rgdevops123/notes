                     <p>In this exercise, you'll create a VPC with IPv4 CIDR block, a subnet with an IPv4
                        CIDR
                        block, and launch a public-facing instance into your subnet. Your instance will be
                        able to
                        communicate with the Internet, and you'll be able to access your instance from your
                        local
                        computer using SSH (if it's a Linux instance) or Remote Desktop (if it's a Windows
                        instance).
                        In your real world environment, you can use this scenario to create a public-facing
                        web
                        server; for example, to host a blog.

                        <p>This exercise is intended to help you set up your own nondefault VPC quickly. If you
                           already have a default VPC and you want to get started launching instances into it
                           (and not
                           creating or configuring a new VPC), see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#launching-into">Launching an EC2 Instance into Your

                                 that
                                 has access to the Internet through an Internet gateway.

                        Services (AWS). When
                        you sign up, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS,
                        including
                        Amazon VPC. If you haven't created an AWS account already, go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>,

                        <p>This exercise assumes that your account supports the EC2-VPC platform only. If your
                           account also supports the older EC2-Classic platform, you can still follow the steps
                           in this
                           exercise; however, you will not have a default VPC in your account to compare against

                     <p>After you've created the VPC, you can view information about the subnet, the Internet
                        gateway, and the route tables. The VPC that you created has two route tables — a
                        main route table that all VPCs have by default, and a custom route table that was
                        created
                        by the wizard. The custom route table is associated with your subnet, which means
                        that the
                        routes in that table determine how the traffic for the subnet flows. If you add a
                        new
                        subnet to your VPC, it uses the main route table by default.

                     <p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for its associated
                        instances. To use a security group, you add the inbound rules to control incoming
                        traffic to
                        the instance, and outbound rules to control the outgoing traffic from your instance.
                        To
                        associate a security group with an instance, you specify the security group when you
                        launch
                        the instance. If you add and remove rules from the security group, we apply those
                        changes to
                        the instances associated with the security group automatically. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Your VPC comes with a <em>default security group</em>. Any instance not
                        associated with another security group during launch is associated with the default
                        security
                        group. In this exercise, you'll create a new security group, <code class="code">WebServerSG</code>, and
                        specify this security group when you launch an instance into your VPC.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <h3 id="getting-started-inbound-outbound-rules">Rules for the WebServerSG Security Group</h3>
                     
                     
                     <p>The following table describes the inbound and outbound rules for the
                        <code class="code">WebServerSG</code> security group. You'll add the inbound rules yourself. The
                        outbound rule is a default rule that allows all outbound communication to anywhere
                        — you do not need to add this rule yourself.

                     <p>In the previous step, you launched your instance into a public subnet — a subnet
                        that has a route to an Internet gateway. However, the instance in your subnet also
                        needs a
                        public IPv4 address to be able to communicate with the Internet. By default, an instance
                        in
                        a nondefault VPC is not assigned a public IPv4 address. In this step, you'll allocate
                        an
                        Elastic IP address to your account, and then associate it with your instance. For
                        more

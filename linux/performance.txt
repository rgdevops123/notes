Q: What is System load/CPU Load?

 A measurement of CPU over or under-utilization in a Linux system; the
number of processes which are being executed by the CPU or in waiting
state. Load average - is the average system load calculated over a
given period of time of 1, 5 and 15 minutes.



Q: What are some performance monitoring tools?

free, iostat, netstat, sar, vmstat



Q: What is vmstat?

Virtual Memory Statistics



Q: What is the format of the vmstat command?

# vmstat 5 5
  vmstat delay count



Q: What is the output of the vmstat command?

   procs    r b
   memory   swap free buff/cache
   swap     si so
   io       bi bo
   system   in cs
   cpu      us sys id wa st

   NOTE:
    Swap
      si: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (/s).
      so: Amount of memory swapped to disk (/s).
    
    IO
      bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
      bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).



Q: How do you display Human readable vmstat output?

   # vmstat -S M
     -S => Switches  outputs  between 1000 (k), 1024 (K), 1000000 (m), or 1048576 (M) bytes.
           Does not change the swap (si/so) or block (bi/bo) fields. 


Q: How do you check network port usage?

   netstat
          -a  (port usage)
          -l  (listeningPorts)
          -n  (I.P.'s)
          -p  (processes)
          -r  (routingTable)
          -i  (interface~errors)
          -s  (stats~packetsDropped)



Q: How would you perform a Network Throughput Test?

ftp> put "|dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k count=1024" /dev/null

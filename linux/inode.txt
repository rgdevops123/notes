Q: What is a Dentry?

A data structure used to represent a Directory.


Q: What is an INODE?

    inode - a data structure used to represent a filesystem object,
which can be one of various things including a file or a directory.


Q: What information is contained in an Inode?

   owner type size
   group permissions dates
   pointers to data


Q: What are the dates in an inode?


Access: last time the contents of the file were examined.
Modify: Last time the contents of the file were changed.
Change: Last time the file's inode was changed.

The change time includes things like modifying the permissions and
ownership, while the modify time refers specifically to the files
contents.


Q: What command/system call can you use to get Inode information?

   stat: Getting inode information

   stat() is a Unix system call that returns useful data about a file inode.

   Example:
# stat /tmp/test123.txt
File: `/tmp/test123.txt'
Size: 23              Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fd02h/64770d    Inode: 17          Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (  500/ user1)   Gid: (  501/   ossec)
Access: 2011-01-21 12:56:05.000000000 -0500
Modify: 2011-01-21 06:36:01.000000000 -0500
Change: 2011-01-21 06:36:01.000000000 -0500


Q: How do you get the long listing of a file?

# ls -l | grep test123.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user1  ossec        23 Jan 21 06:36 test123.txt


Q: How do you get the inode number of a file?

# ls -i | grep test123.txt
17 test123.txt

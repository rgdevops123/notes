   Sessions:

Unlike a Cookie, Session data is stored on server. Session is the time interval when a client logs into a server and logs out of it. The data, which is needed to be held across this session, is stored in a temporary directory on the server.

A session with each client is assigned a Session ID. The Session data is stored on top of cookies and the server signs them cryptographically. For this encryption, the web application needs a defined SECRET_KEY.

Session object is also a dictionary object containing key-value pairs of session variables and associated values.

   For example, to set a 'username' session variable use the statement âˆ’

>>> Session['username'] = 'admin'

   To release a session variable use pop() method.

>>> session.pop('username', None)

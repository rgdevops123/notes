Q: What does sar stand for?

   System Activity Report


Q: How do you install sar?

   # yum -y install sysstat


Q: What does the default sar cron look like?

# cat /etc/cron.d/sysstat

# Run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1

# Generate a daily summary of process accounting at 23:53

53 23 * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa2 -A

So the first cron entry will run every 10 minutes which will call the
sadc utility and collect system stats and store it in a binary file.
And the second cron entry will dump all the contents of that binary
file into another text file.

Firewall: iptables

What is a Firewall?

 A firewall is a list of rules, so when an incomming connection is open, if it matches any of the rules, this rule can accept that connection or reject it. If no rules are met, we use the default rule.

   Open Ports:
22   SSH
80   HTTP
443  HTTPS


   Flush the firewall rules - Erase them all:

# iptables -F


   Take all incoming packets with tcp flags NONE or ALL and just DROP them:
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP


   Syn-flood attack means that the attackers open a new connection,
     but do not state what they want (ie. SYN, ACK, whatever). 
     They just want to take up our servers' resources. 
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j DROP


   We tell iptables to add (-A) a rule to the incoming (INPUT) 
     filter table any trafic that comes to localhost interface (-i lo) 
     and to accept (-j ACCEPT) it.
# iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT


   We added the two ports (http port 80, and https port 443) to the ACCEPT chain
   - allowing traffic in on those ports.
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT



   Allow SSH Traffic.
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT


   Allow any established outgoing connections to receive replies. 
# iptables -I INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT


   Allow all outgoing connections.
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT


   Block all other incoming connections.
# iptables -P INPUT DROP


   List the rules.
# iptables -L -n




   Save the configuration.
# iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables


# service iptables restart

Q: What is the difference between a logical link and hard link?

inode & across filesystems.

- Hard Link: link to physical file
   More than one filename reference the same inode number.
   Hard links must reside on the same filesystem as the real/source file.
   The real/source file must exist.

- Soft Link: link to path
   Special file (with unique inode) is created that points to real/source file.
   Special file is called 'soft link' or a 'symbolic link' (aka a 'symlink').
   Soft links can reside on separate filesystems than the real/source file.
   The real/source file does not have to exist.
   Additional I/O necessary to complete file access.
   Additional storage taken up by Soft Link's file data.




Q: What are the process states in Unix?

Running : The process is either running or it is ready to run.

Waiting : The process is waiting for an event or for a resource.

Stopped : The process has been stopped, usually by receiving a signal.

Zombie : The process is dead but have not been removed from the process table.




Q: What is a Zombie process?

   Zombie = When a program forks and the child finishes before the
parent, the kernel still keeps some of its information about the child
in case the parent might need it - for example, the parent may need to
check the child's exit status. To be able to get this information, the
parent calls `wait()'; In the interval between the child terminating
and the parent calling `wait()', the child is said to be a `zombie'.


A zombie process is a one which has completed execution, however it’s entry is still in the process table to allow the parent to read the child’s exit status. The reason the process is a zombie is because it is “dead” but not yet “reaped” by it’s parent. Parent processes normally issue the wait system call to read the child’s exit status whereupon the zombie is removed. The kill command does not work on zombie process. When a child dies the parent receives a SIGCHLD signal.

(If you do `ps', the child will have a `Z' in its status field to
indicate this.)

Finding Zombies => ps aux | grep -w Z


Q: How can you create and test for a Zombie process?

# vim zombie.c
+++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main ()
{
  pid_t child_pid;

  child_pid = fork ();
  if (child_pid > 0) {
    sleep (60);
  }
  else {
    exit (0);
  }
  return 0;
}
+++

# cc zombie.c -o zombie

# ./zombie

# ps aux | grep -w Z
root      9662  0.0  0.0      0     0 pts/0    Z+   21:29   0:00
[zombie] <defunct>


Q: What is a Orphan process?

   Orphan = An orphan process is a computer process whose parent
process has finished or terminated, though itself remains running.

In a Unix-like operating system any orphaned process will be
immediately adopted by the special init system process. This operation
is called re-parenting and occurs automatically. Even though
technically the process has the "init" process as its parent, it is
still called an orphan process since the process that originally
created it no longer exists.


Q: How do you find Orphan process?

# ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}'

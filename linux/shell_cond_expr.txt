Q: What is a script that can check for the existence of the messages file?

   Sample Script:
# vim file_check.sh
+++
#!/bin/bash

echo "This script checks the existence of a file."
sleep 1

echo "Checking..."
sleep 1

if [ -f $1 ]
  then
    echo "File $1 exists."
else
  echo "File $1 does not exist."
fi

echo
sleep 1

echo "...done."
+++

Running:
# bash file_check.sh /var/log/messages
This script checks the existence of a file.
Checking...
File /var/log/messages exists.

...done.

# bash file_check.sh /var/log/nofile
This script checks the existence of a file.
Checking...
File /var/log/nofile does not exist.

...done.

Q) What is Ansible?

Ansible is Free and Open Source and Maintained by Redhat.

Can handle IT orchestration where tasks are run in sequence in several different machines or servers.

Ansible does this by connecting to multiple machines through SSH and runs the tasks which have been configured into playbooks and uses a simple language called YAML (Yet Another Markup Language).

Ansible does not use an agent to automate tasks on different machines.


Q) What are Ansible's three main components?

Control Machine
Inventory
Playbook


Q) What does the Control Machine do?

 The Control Machine manages the execution of the Playbook.


Q) What is the main Ansible configuration File?

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


Q) What is the purpose of the Inventory file?

The Inventory file provides a complete list of all the target machines on which various modules are run by doing an ssh connection and installing the necessary software.

Ansible uses the concept of Inventory to manage and track the target machines.


Q) What is the Ansible Server Inventory File?

/etc/ansible/hosts


Q) What does the Ansible Server Inventory File look like?  What is the format?

A host file consists of groups for better classification and multiple machines under the group.
All the required machines can be added to those groups.

Every group is denoted by a square bracket and a group name within.
A server can actually exist in multiple groups.


Q) What is the purpose of the Playbook?

The Playbook consists of steps that the control mechanism will perform on the servers defined in the inventory file.
Playbooks define variables, configurations, deployment steps, assign roles, perform multiple tasks.

    Every playbook starts with 3 hyphens '---'
1) Host section – Defines the target machines on which the playbook should run. This is based on the Ansible inventory file.
2) Variable section – This is optional and can declare all the variables needed in the playbook. We will look at some examples as well.
3) Tasks section – This section lists out all the tasks that should be executed on the target machine. It specifies the use of Modules. Every task has a name which is a small description of what the task will do and will be listed while the playbook is run.


Q) How do you run a Playbook?

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>


Q) How do yo check a Playbook for syntax Errors?

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --syntax-check


Q) How do you list the hosts in for a Playbook?

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --list-hosts


Q) How does Ansible interact with all the servers defined in the inventory?

Ansible interacts with all the servers defined in the inventory through the SSH protocol which is a secure method of remote login. Every operation is done and file transfer is encrypted.

Ansible does not use any kind of database for installation


Q) What are Ansible Modules?

Modules are the main building blocks of Ansible and are basically reusable scripts that are used by Ansible playbooks. Ansible comes with a number of reusable modules. These include functionality for controlling services, software package installation, working with files and directories etc.


Q) What is the syntax for running ad-hoc Ansible commands?

$ ansible hostORgroup   -m module_name     -a "arguments"     -u username      --become


Q) How do you test Connectivity of the servers under the webserver’s group?
$ ansible webservers –m ping


Q) How do you list the hosts in the inventory file?
$ ansible webservers --list-hosts


Q) What are Ansible playbooks?

 They are used to execute multiple tasks and get all the target machines or servers to a particular desired state.


Q) What are Ansible roles?

They can group your variables, tasks, handlers, configuration files and templates.  This increase reusability and reduces syntax errors. It helps to de-clutter the whole code.


Q) What are Ansible roles similar to in Puppet and Chef?

Modules in Puppet.
Cookbooks in Chef.

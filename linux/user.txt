Q: Create a system account with a specified home directory.

# useradd -r app1 -d /apps/app1
     Creates an "app1" user and an "/apps/app1" home directory.

-r, --system
           Create a system account.

           System users will be created with no aging information in
/etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are chosen in the
           SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in /etc/login.defs,
instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the
           creation of groups).

           Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such
an user, regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs
           (CREATE_HOME). You have to specify the -m options if you
want a home directory for a system account to be created.

-d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
           The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value
for the user's login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN
           name to BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name.

/etc/profile
/etc/security/
/etc/skel/
/etc/profile.d/*
